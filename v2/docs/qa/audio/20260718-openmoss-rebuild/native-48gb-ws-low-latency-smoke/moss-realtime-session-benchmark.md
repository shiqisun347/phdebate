# MOSS-TTS-Realtime native session benchmark

- Generated: 2026-07-18T02:13:54.627330+00:00
- Candidate endpoints: 1 (addresses redacted)
- Transport: websocket
- Protocol: persistent WS start -> ready.audio -> sequenced text_delta/ack -> final/ack -> tail PCM -> audio_end -> released
- First PCM origin: first body text_delta/push send time (handshake is reported separately).
- Evidence boundary: transport/model only; CER, MOS and speaker drift remain separate gates.

| Concurrency | Success | Handshake P50/P95/max ms | Non-silent PCM P50/P95/max ms | RTF/active P95 | Gap P99 max ms | 100ms underruns/max ms | Lifecycle | Release gate |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| 1 | 3/3 | 263.598/266.654/266.994 | 782.964/810.1/813.115 | 1.202/0.961 | 2405.027 | 14/2495.516 | FAIL | NO-GO |

Release gate: c1/c2/c3 each contain 20 batches; every request has non-silent PCM under 3s before final, first PCM P95 <=800ms, RTF P95 <=0.65, chunk-gap P99 <=200ms, and release ACK.
